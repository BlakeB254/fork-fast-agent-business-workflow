- Intelligent suggestions for empty fields
- Contextual guidance for field completion
- Optional and required field designations

### Improved Document Generation
- Executive-oversight of document creation
- High-quality business document templates
- Multi-agent collaboration for comprehensive document generation

## Original Features

## How to Run the Demo

### Option 1: Using Python's built-in HTTP server

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BlakeB254/fork-fast-agent-business-workflow.git
cd fork-fast-agent-business-workflow

# Start a simple HTTP server
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then navigate to: http://localhost:8000/ui/

### Option 2: Using Node.js http-server

If you have Node.js installed:

```bash
# Install http-server globally if not already installed
npm install -g http-server

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BlakeB254/fork-fast-agent-business-workflow.git
cd fork-fast-agent-business-workflow

# Start the server
http-server
```

Then navigate to: http://localhost:8080/ui/
